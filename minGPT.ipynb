    "# Tiny GPT Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this walkthrough on how to implement GPT from scratch! \n",
    "\n",
    "Much of this notebook is taken from Andrej Karpathy's video [\"Let's build GPT\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy) and its corresponding resources. However, this notebook is reworked to provide a more notebook-first experience, to aid hands-on learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will cover basic concepts such as attention and next-token prediction that are crucial to understanding how GPT works. This walkthrough will not cover much of the finer details of reproducing GPT performance. We'll be using a smaller dataset and single-GPU training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "Let's download our dataset that we will be training on. GPT-2 and later iterations of GPT were trained on closed-source, large, web-scale datasets. We'll instead be using a much smaller dataset for instructional and practical purposes."
